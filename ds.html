        <b><font color='pale blue'>Data scientists who work in AI and robotics R&D aren’t just building better machines, they’re also building better data science. Artificial intelligence is key to processing the massive volumes of disparate digital information that data scientists work with every day. And data science is key to furthering the development of artificial intelligence by developing the algorithms by which artilects process information and develop “intelligence.”</font></b></h4>

        <h2><b><font color='gold'>How the Application of Data Science to AI is Advancing Data Science Itself:</font></h2>
        <h4>As data scientists use machine learning to process large data sets, they are developing a deeper understanding of the process of data science itself.
            Of course, experience, intuition, and some preliminary searches inform the initial attempts at data analysis before an approach is altered on the basis of the results. Still, data scientists have traditionally begun their analysis of a data set more or less by brail. This has been recognized as a major bottleneck in the data science process. However, new developments in AI are changing all that.
            At MIT, a program called the “Data Science Machine” churns through massive data sets and builds predictive models to identify relevant features just like data scientists have done manually for years. And the machine is beating the humans at coming up with those models.
            </b></h4>

        <br><br>
        <h2><b><font color='gold'>The Concept of Deep Learning: Teaching Machines to Teach Themselves:</font></h2> 
        <h3><b>For years, AI researchers focused on making robots smarter by programming them with the best algorithms they could invent for dealing with the routine inputs and situations the robot was expected to face. If it had to open a door, for example, routines would be written to recognize the door, intercept the doorknob with a manipulator, twist the knob a certain number of degrees, and pull.
            It didn’t take long for them to run into the limitations of that approach: Doorknobs have different appearances, different heights. Sometimes there are push bars. More force – but not too much – may be required when a door is stuck or obstructed. The variety of situations encountered couldn’t be accounted for in a lifetime of coding performed by mere humans.
            Problems also emerged with allowing humans to interact with this rudimentary AI. Natural language parsing, something that humans do instinctively, involves many rules that are either fuzzy or frequently broken. Machines could not reasonably be programmed to handle more than a small subset of the possible inputs— and those inputs had to be typed into a terminal. Deciphering handwriting or speech seemed impossible, as teaching machines to “see” and “hear” were even more complex problems.

        <h2><font color='gold'>How Data Science Is Helping in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence:</h2></font>
        <h3><b>Big data and data science are set to bring in a digital revolution with groundbreaking technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning. The essence of data science is to dive into massive datasets to extract meaningful information from them. The insights that data scientists and data analysts obtain from large volumes of data is the secret sauce that’s rapidly transforming everything around us. Institutions and organizations across various sectors of the industry are now leveraging data science technologies to power innovation and technology-driven change. In fact, nearly 53 percent of companies have adopted big data analytics in 2017, which is an enormous growth from the 17 percent in 2015.</b></h3>
        <br>
        <h2><font color='gold'>Data Science and Artificial Intelligence:</font></h2>
        <h3><b>The fields of data science, AI, and ML are intrinsically linked to one another. While artificial intelligence is a broad umbrella that includes a wide range of applications, right from text analysis to robotics, machine learning, is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on training machines how to ‘learn’ via advanced algorithms and perform specific tasks while simultaneously improving performance through experience. Data science is a branch of computer science that deals in the extraction of valuable insights from vast datasets through a combination of disciplines such as mathematics, ML, statistics, and data engineering.
            Today, AI and ML technologies are transforming the industrial landscape, and this is possible only because these technologies are backed by data science. While AI is about creating “intelligent and smart” machines, it cannot do without ML. As mentioned before, machine learning algorithms are required to train machines to learn from behavior patterns and cues. Then again, ML cannot function without analytics, which in turn cannot function without data infrastructure. Harvard Business Review maintains that, “companies with strong basic analytics—such as sales data and market trends—make breakthroughs in complex and critical areas after layering in artificial intelligence.” However, for AI to create a true impact, you require the right data and a team of experienced and trained data science professionals who know where to look for the data and how to integrate it with AI and ML tools.
            </b></h3>

        <h2><font color='gold'>Data Science and Robotics:</font></h2>
        <h3><b>With the advance in data science, the field of robotics has definitely improved to a great extent. During the initial days of development, scientists were faced with two major challenges -one, predicting every action of a robot, and two, reducing the computational complexity in real-time vision tasks.
            While robots could perform specific functions, it was impossible for scientists to predict their next move. For every new functionality, a robot would have to be reprogrammed every time, which made the task a tedious one. Another major obstacle with robots is that unlike humans who use their unique sense of vision to make sense of the world around them, robots can only visualize the world in a series of zeros and ones. Thus, accomplishing real-time vision tasks for robots would mean a fresh set of zeros and ones every time a new trend emerges, thereby increasing the computational complexity.
            Enter machine learning to solve these issues in robotics. With ML, robots can acquire new behavior patterns through labeled data. Handwriting recognition is an excellent example. In handwriting recognition, computers are fed with labeled data—both positive and negative. Once the computer has successfully learned to differentiate between positive and negative examples, it is presented with new data. Based on the previous experience (during the training phase), the computer can predict the qualified classifiers for recognizing the handwriting. Thanks to advanced ML algorithms powered by tons of data that computers are now able to perform handwriting recognition much more accurately than they were ten years ago.
            Furthermore, reinforcement learning, the branch of ML that is “the closest that machine learning can get to the way how humans learn” teaches computers and robots to perform specific functions according to their environment to generate outcomes that fetch either rewards or penalties. Thus, every time the robots lead to penalties, they can learn from their mistakes and know what course of action to take to fetch awards. Personalized recommendation lists of online portals such as Amazon and Netflix are the best examples of reinforcement learning. This wasn’t possible ten years ago!
